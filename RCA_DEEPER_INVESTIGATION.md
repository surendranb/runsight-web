# üîç Deeper RCA: Variables Set But Not Accessible

## üö® **New Information**
- ‚úÖ Environment variables ARE set in Netlify dashboard
- ‚ùå Debug function shows ALL variables as missing
- ‚ùå Functions can't access the variables

## üéØ **Revised Root Cause Analysis**

This suggests a **variable access issue**, not a missing variable issue.

### **Possible Root Causes**

#### **1. Variable Name Mismatch**
**Question**: Are variables set with correct names?
- Variables might be set as `VITE_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` instead of `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`
- Functions expect exact names without `VITE_` prefix

#### **2. Deployment Timing Issue**
**Question**: Was site redeployed AFTER setting variables?
- Variables set but site not redeployed
- Functions still using old deployment without variables

#### **3. Branch Mismatch**
**Question**: Are variables set for the correct branch?
- Variables might be set for `main` branch
- But site is deployed from `secure-serverless-architecture` branch

#### **4. Site Mismatch**
**Question**: Are variables set on the correct Netlify site?
- Multiple Netlify sites for same repo
- Variables set on wrong site

#### **5. Function Runtime Issue**
**Question**: Are variables not being passed to function runtime?
- Netlify configuration issue
- Function bundling problem

#### **6. Build Process Issue**
**Question**: Are functions being built correctly?
- Functions not included in deployment
- Environment variables not accessible during function execution

## üîç **Diagnostic Questions**

### **Please Check These Specific Items:**

#### **1. Variable Names**
In Netlify dashboard, are the variables named exactly:
- `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID` (not `VITE_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`)
- `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` (not `VITE_STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- `SUPABASE_URL` (not `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`)
- etc.

#### **2. Deployment Branch**
- Which branch is your Netlify site deployed from?
- Are environment variables set for that specific branch?

#### **3. Recent Deployment**
- When did you last set the environment variables?
- When was the last successful deployment?
- Did you redeploy AFTER setting the variables?

#### **4. Site Configuration**
- Are you looking at the correct Netlify site (`resonant-pony-ea7953`)?
- Do you have multiple sites for this repo?

## üß™ **Additional Tests**

### **Test 1: Check Function Deployment**
Visit: https://resonant-pony-ea7953.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/
Should show function list or 404 (not 500)

### **Test 2: Check Build Logs**
1. Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys
2. Click latest deploy
3. Look for function-related errors in build logs

### **Test 3: Check Function Configuration**
1. Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Functions
2. Are all 6 functions listed?
3. Any error indicators?

## üéØ **Most Likely Scenarios**

### **Scenario A: Variable Names Wrong**
- Variables set as `VITE_STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`
- Functions expect `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`
- **Fix**: Rename variables (remove `VITE_` prefix)

### **Scenario B: Need Redeploy**
- Variables set correctly
- Site not redeployed after setting them
- **Fix**: Trigger new deployment

### **Scenario C: Branch Mismatch**
- Variables set for `main` branch
- Site deployed from `secure-serverless-architecture` branch
- **Fix**: Set variables for correct branch or merge to main

## üîß **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Verify Variable Names**
Screenshot your Netlify environment variables page - let's see the exact names

### **Step 2: Check Deployment Branch**
What branch is your site deployed from?

### **Step 3: Force Redeploy**
Trigger a new deployment after confirming variables are set

### **Step 4: Check Build Logs**
Look for any function-related errors in the build process

## üéØ **Expected Resolution**

Once we identify the specific issue:
- Variable name fix ‚Üí Immediate resolution
- Redeploy needed ‚Üí Resolution after deployment
- Branch mismatch ‚Üí Resolution after setting variables for correct branch

The fact that functions are deployed (debug function works) but can't access variables suggests a configuration issue, not a code issue.
