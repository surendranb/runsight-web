# Testing Workflow for Task Completion

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach to be followed at the end of each major task (not subtasks) to ensure code quality and deployment readiness.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Local Build Verification
Before deploying, always run a local build to catch any compilation errors:

```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected outcome:** Build should complete successfully without errors. Warnings about chunk size are acceptable but should be noted.

### 2. TypeScript Type Checking
Verify there are no TypeScript errors:

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Expected outcome:** No TypeScript compilation errors.

### 3. Code Quality Check (Optional)
If ESLint is properly configured, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

**Note:** Currently ESLint configuration needs migration to v9 format. This step can be skipped if configuration issues exist, but TypeScript checking covers most issues.

### 4. Git Workflow
After successful local testing:

1. **Stage all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

2. **Commit with descriptive message:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: [task description]
   
   - [key change 1]
   - [key change 2]
   - [key change 3]
   
   Completed task [X] and all subtasks"
   ```

3. **Push to trigger deployment:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 5. Deployment Verification
After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Monitor Netlify deployment** (automatic via GitHub integration)
2. **Test deployed application** at the live URL
3. **Verify key functionality** works as expected
4. **Check for any runtime errors** in browser console

### 6. Feedback Loop
If issues are found during testing:

1. **Document the issue** clearly
2. **Create a fix** locally
3. **Re-run testing steps 1-3**
4. **Deploy fix** using steps 4-5
5. **Re-verify** functionality

## Testing Checklist Template

Use this checklist at the end of each major task:

- [ ] Local build completes successfully (`npm run build`)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] Changes committed with descriptive message
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Netlify deployment successful
- [ ] Live application tested manually
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Key functionality verified working
- [ ] Ready for next task or user feedback

## When to Apply This Workflow

- ✅ **Apply after:** Major tasks (e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.)
- ❌ **Skip for:** Individual subtasks (e.g., Task 1.1, 1.2, 1.3)
- ✅ **Apply after:** Significant feature completions
- ✅ **Apply before:** Requesting user feedback or testing

## Benefits

1. **Early error detection** before deployment
2. **Consistent code quality** across iterations
3. **Reliable deployment process** with verification
4. **Faster feedback cycles** with working deployments
5. **Reduced debugging time** by catching issues locally

## Notes

- This workflow ensures each major milestone is properly tested and deployed
- Local testing catches most issues before they reach production
- The commit message format helps track progress and changes
- Manual testing of the deployed app is crucial for UX verification
