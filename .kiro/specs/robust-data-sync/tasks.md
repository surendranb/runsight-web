# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan builds a completely new, robust data sync system from the ground up. We're not retrofitting the broken existing system - we're building what should be. The plan follows a test-driven, incremental approach that ensures each component is solid before building the next.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **Test-Driven Development:** Write tests first for each component
- **Incremental Building:** Each task builds on the previous, ensuring solid foundations
- **Clean Architecture:** No dependencies on legacy code - build what should be
- **Platform Optimization:** Leverage Netlify and Supabase strengths from the start

### Key Principles
- **Reliability First:** Every component must handle failures gracefully
- **Observability Built-In:** Logging and monitoring from day one
- **User Experience:** Real-time feedback and clear error messages
- **Performance:** Efficient resource usage and fast sync times
- **Security:** Proper authentication and data isolation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete user flows
- Performance tests with realistic data volumes
- Error injection tests for resilience validation

### Deployment Strategy
- Deploy to staging environment first
- Use feature flags for gradual user rollout
- Monitor metrics closely during rollout
- Have rollback plan ready
- Migrate existing user data carefully
