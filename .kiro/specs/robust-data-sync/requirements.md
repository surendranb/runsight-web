# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current data sync system in RunSight Web is fundamentally broken with multiple architectural issues that prevent reliable data synchronization from Strava. The system suffers from inconsistent error handling, fragmented responsibilities across multiple functions, unreliable token management, and poor user experience during sync operations. We need to completely reimagine the data sync architecture to create a robust, reliable, and user-friendly system that can handle the complexities of external API integration, data enrichment, and storage operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Reliable Data Fetching

**User Story:** As a runner, I want my Strava activities to be reliably fetched and synchronized, so that I can trust that all my running data is available in RunSight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a sync THEN the system SHALL fetch all running activities from Strava within the specified time range
2. WHEN Strava API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
3. WHEN Strava access tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh tokens without user intervention
4. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry failed requests up to 3 times with increasing delays
5. WHEN Strava returns partial data THEN the system SHALL detect and handle incomplete responses appropriately
6. WHEN activities are already synced THEN the system SHALL skip duplicate activities efficiently
7. WHEN sync is interrupted THEN the system SHALL be able to resume from the last successful checkpoint

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Data Enrichment

**User Story:** As a runner, I want my activities enriched with weather and location data, so that I can analyze how environmental conditions affect my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN activities have GPS coordinates THEN the system SHALL fetch historical weather data from OpenWeatherMap
2. WHEN weather API requests fail THEN the system SHALL continue processing other activities without blocking the entire sync
3. WHEN activities lack GPS data THEN the system SHALL store them without weather enrichment and log the reason
4. WHEN geocoding is available THEN the system SHALL enrich activities with city, state, and country information
5. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate backoff strategies for weather services
6. WHEN weather data is unavailable for a specific time/location THEN the system SHALL store the activity with null weather data
7. WHEN enrichment fails for some activities THEN the system SHALL provide detailed reporting on success/failure rates

### Requirement 3: Atomic and Consistent Data Storage

**User Story:** As a runner, I want my data to be stored reliably and consistently, so that I never lose activity data due to system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing activities THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure data consistency
2. WHEN duplicate activities are detected THEN the system SHALL update existing records rather than create duplicates
3. WHEN storage operations fail THEN the system SHALL rollback partial changes and provide clear error messages
4. WHEN the database is temporarily unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry
5. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue with valid records
6. WHEN concurrent sync operations occur THEN the system SHALL handle race conditions appropriately
7. WHEN storage is successful THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation with saved/updated/skipped counts

### Requirement 4: Transparent Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a runner, I want to see real-time progress during sync operations, so that I understand what's happening and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync starts THEN the system SHALL display the estimated total number of activities to process
2. WHEN processing activities THEN the system SHALL show current progress with percentage completion
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages without stopping the entire sync
4. WHEN sync completes THEN the system SHALL show a detailed summary of results (saved/updated/skipped/failed)
5. WHEN sync is running THEN the user SHALL be able to cancel the operation safely
6. WHEN sync is cancelled THEN the system SHALL complete the current batch and stop gracefully
7. WHEN sync encounters issues THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 5: Robust Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a runner, I want the sync system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand and resolve any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication with clear instructions
2. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL wait and retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN external APIs return errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue processing
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL skip invalid records and report the issues
5. WHEN system resources are exhausted THEN the system SHALL throttle operations and provide feedback
6. WHEN unrecoverable errors occur THEN the system SHALL save progress and allow manual retry
7. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL allow resuming sync from the last successful point

### Requirement 6: Efficient Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the sync process to use resources efficiently, so that it doesn't impact other system operations or exceed service limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use streaming and batching to manage memory usage
2. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL respect rate limits and implement appropriate delays
3. WHEN multiple users sync simultaneously THEN the system SHALL queue and throttle operations appropriately
4. WHEN sync operations are idle THEN the system SHALL release resources and clean up temporary data
5. WHEN database connections are needed THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling efficiently
6. WHEN external API quotas are approaching limits THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical operations
7. WHEN system load is high THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust processing speed

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed monitoring and logging of sync operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sync operations run THEN the system SHALL log detailed timing and performance metrics
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log stack traces, context, and recovery actions taken
3. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request/response details for debugging
4. WHEN data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately
5. WHEN sync patterns change THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on usage and performance trends
6. WHEN system health degrades THEN the system SHALL provide early warning indicators
7. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN the system SHALL provide correlation IDs for tracing operations across services

### Requirement 8: Platform-Optimized Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the sync system to be optimized for Netlify Functions and Supabase, so that it leverages platform strengths and avoids platform limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the sync architecture THEN the system SHALL work within Netlify Functions' 10-second execution limit for synchronous operations
2. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's real-time capabilities for progress updates
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL leverage Supabase's Row Level Security for user data isolation
4. WHEN handling long-running operations THEN the system SHALL use Netlify's background functions or queue-based processing
5. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use Supabase as the single source of truth rather than function-local storage
6. WHEN implementing retries THEN the system SHALL use Supabase's built-in retry mechanisms and connection pooling
7. WHEN scaling operations THEN the system SHALL leverage Netlify's automatic function scaling and Supabase's connection management
8. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL integrate seamlessly with Supabase Auth and Strava OAuth flows
