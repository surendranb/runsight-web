# RunSight Vision & Requirements

## Introduction

RunSight is a comprehensive running analytics platform that transforms raw Strava data into actionable insights. Unlike basic activity trackers, RunSight focuses on understanding the deeper patterns in your running performance by correlating environmental factors, performance metrics, and behavioral patterns to help runners optimize their training and performance.

## Core Vision

**"Turn your running data into your competitive advantage"**

RunSight should be the app that answers questions like:
- "What weather conditions help me run my fastest?"
- "Am I getting more consistent over time?"
- "Which routes or locations produce my best performances?"
- "How does my performance vary by time of day or season?"
- "What patterns predict my personal records?"

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Data Foundation

**User Story:** As a runner, I want all my historical running data properly synced and enriched so I can analyze long-term patterns and trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect my Strava account THEN the system SHALL sync all my historical running activities without arbitrary limits
2. WHEN activities are synced THEN they SHALL be enriched with weather data from the time and location of each run
3. WHEN activities are synced THEN they SHALL include location information (city, state, country) for geographic analysis
4. WHEN I view my data THEN I SHALL see activities spanning my entire running history, not just recent months

### Requirement 2: Weather Performance Analytics

**User Story:** As a runner, I want to understand how weather conditions affect my performance so I can optimize my training and race day strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view weather analytics THEN I SHALL see my performance metrics correlated with temperature, humidity, wind, and weather conditions
2. WHEN I check today's weather THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations based on my historical performance in similar conditions
3. WHEN I analyze my runs THEN I SHALL see patterns like "You run 12% faster in 60-70Â°F weather" or "Your best pace occurs in light rain"
4. WHEN planning a race THEN I SHALL get weather-based performance predictions and strategy recommendations

### Requirement 3: Performance Trend Analysis

**User Story:** As a runner, I want to track my performance trends over time to understand my progress and identify areas for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view performance trends THEN I SHALL see pace, distance, and consistency improvements over time
2. WHEN I analyze my training THEN I SHALL see patterns in my running frequency, volume, and intensity
3. WHEN I check my progress THEN I SHALL see personal records, achievements, and milestone tracking
4. WHEN I review periods THEN I SHALL see monthly, seasonal, and yearly performance summaries

### Requirement 4: Location Intelligence

**User Story:** As a runner, I want to understand how different locations and routes affect my performance so I can choose optimal training and racing venues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view location analytics THEN I SHALL see performance metrics by city, state, elevation, and terrain type
2. WHEN I travel THEN I SHALL get recommendations for optimal running conditions in new locations
3. WHEN I analyze routes THEN I SHALL see which locations consistently produce my best performances
4. WHEN planning runs THEN I SHALL get location-based suggestions for achieving specific performance goals

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Insights Engine

**User Story:** As a runner, I want the app to automatically discover patterns and insights in my data that I might miss, providing actionable recommendations for improvement.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the app THEN I SHALL see personalized insights based on my recent running patterns
2. WHEN patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight significant correlations and trends
3. WHEN I receive insights THEN they SHALL be actionable with specific recommendations for improvement
4. WHEN insights are generated THEN they SHALL be based on statistically significant data, not random correlations

### Requirement 6: Advanced Performance Metrics

**User Story:** As a serious runner, I want detailed performance analytics that go beyond basic pace and distance to help me optimize my training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I analyze performance THEN I SHALL see metrics like consistency scores, performance variability, and improvement rates
2. WHEN I review workouts THEN I SHALL see effort analysis based on pace, heart rate, and elevation
3. WHEN I track progress THEN I SHALL see performance predictions and goal achievement probability
4. WHEN I compare periods THEN I SHALL see detailed breakdowns of what factors contributed to performance changes

### Requirement 7: Modern Dashboard & User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clean, modern dashboard that presents my running data in an intuitive and visually appealing way, focusing on what matters most.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the dashboard THEN I SHALL see a clean, uncluttered interface that highlights key metrics and insights
2. WHEN I view my data THEN the most important information SHALL be prominently displayed with secondary details easily accessible
3. WHEN I navigate the app THEN the interface SHALL feel modern and responsive with smooth transitions and interactions
4. WHEN I view analytics THEN complex data SHALL be presented through clear, beautiful visualizations that tell a story
5. WHEN I use the app on different devices THEN the experience SHALL be optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile
6. WHEN I interact with features THEN the app SHALL provide immediate visual feedback and guide me toward relevant actions

### Requirement 8: AI-Powered Coaching & Goal Tracking

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set annual goals THEN the AI SHALL analyze my historical data to assess goal feasibility and create milestone targets
2. WHEN I check my progress THEN the system SHALL tell me if I'm on track to meet my goals with specific metrics and recommendations
3. WHEN I'm behind on goals THEN the AI SHALL provide actionable advice on training adjustments needed to get back on track
4. WHEN I achieve milestones THEN the system SHALL celebrate progress and adjust future recommendations accordingly
5. WHEN planning training THEN the AI SHALL suggest optimal workout types, frequencies, and intensities based on my goals and current fitness

### Requirement 9: Data Privacy and Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my running data to be secure and private, with full control over how it's used and shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect my accounts THEN my authentication tokens SHALL be securely stored and encrypted
