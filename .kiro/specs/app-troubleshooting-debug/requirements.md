# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a comprehensive troubleshooting and debugging system for the RunSight application. The current application has deployment issues, sync failures, and various error states that need systematic investigation and resolution. We need tools and processes to quickly identify, diagnose, and fix issues in both development and production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive debugging tools and processes, so that I can quickly identify and resolve application issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs in the application THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stack traces, request context, and environment state
2. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging for all critical operations
3. WHEN investigating issues THEN the system SHALL provide tools to inspect API responses, database queries, and external service calls
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL categorize them by type (network, authentication, data, etc.) for faster resolution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated testing and validation tools, so that I can verify application functionality without manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL validate all critical user flows automatically
2. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL verify response formats and status codes
3. WHEN external services are integrated THEN the system SHALL test connectivity and authentication
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity and constraints

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment validation tools, so that I can ensure all configurations are correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL validate all required environment variables are present
2. WHEN connecting to external services THEN the system SHALL verify API keys and credentials are valid
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN the system SHALL confirm connectivity and permissions
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL perform health checks on all dependencies

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error reproduction and isolation tools, so that I can consistently reproduce and fix bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error is reported THEN the system SHALL provide steps to reproduce the issue
2. WHEN debugging specific components THEN the system SHALL allow isolated testing of individual functions
3. WHEN investigating sync failures THEN the system SHALL provide mock data and test scenarios
4. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL simulate various failure modes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want monitoring and alerting capabilities, so that I can proactively identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL monitor key performance metrics
2. WHEN errors occur frequently THEN the system SHALL alert developers with detailed context
3. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL track and report service availability
4. WHEN user actions fail THEN the system SHALL log user journey context for debugging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment validation tools, so that I can ensure successful deployments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is deployed THEN the system SHALL verify all functions are accessible and working
2. WHEN environment changes occur THEN the system SHALL validate configuration consistency
3. WHEN new features are deployed THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests to verify basic functionality
4. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN the system SHALL provide quick rollback verification tools
