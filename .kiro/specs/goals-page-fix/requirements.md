# Goals Page Integration Fix - Requirements

## Introduction

The Goals page component has been built and integrated into the codebase, but users are still seeing a "Coming Soon!" placeholder when navigating to the Goals tab. The AI Coach is working correctly in the Dashboard, but the Goals page routing is not functioning properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Goals Page Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the actual Goals page when I click on the Goals tab, so that I can create and manage my running goals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on the "Goals" tab in the navigation THEN I SHALL see the Goals page with goal creation functionality
2. WHEN I navigate to the Goals section THEN I SHALL NOT see a "Coming Soon!" message

5. WHEN I create any goal THEN I SHALL see it appear in the goals list with appropriate progress tracking for that goal type

### Requirement 3: Goals Page Functionality

3. WHEN I view my goals THEN I SHALL see progress bars, status indicators, and time remaining
4. WHEN I have goals THEN I SHALL see AI insights and recommendations related to my goals
5. WHEN I have multiple goals THEN I SHALL be able to prioritize them and see them organized by priority

### Requirement 4: AI Coach Progress Tracking and Course Correction

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI Coach to track my progress toward goals and recommend course corrections when I'm falling behind or need to adjust my training approach.
