# Implementation Plan

## Testing Protocol
After completing each major task (not subtasks), follow the testing workflow:
1. Run `npm run build` to verify local build
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check TypeScript errors  
3. Commit and push changes to trigger deployment
4. Wait 10 minutes for Netlify deployment to complete
5. Use Playwright to test deployed application at https://resonant-pony-ea7953.netlify.app/
6. Verify key functionality works as expected in production environment
7. See `.kiro/steering/testing-workflow.md` for detailed Playwright testing steps
