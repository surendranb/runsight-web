# Implementation Plan

## Testing Protocol
After completing each major task (not subtasks), follow the testing workflow:
1. Run `npm run build` to verify local build
2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check TypeScript errors  
3. Commit and push changes to trigger deployment
4. Test deployed application and provide feedback
