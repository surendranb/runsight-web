# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive improvements needed to make RunSight Web launch-ready as an open-source project. The focus is on creating a polished, user-friendly runner's companion that provides actionable insights while maintaining excellent UX/UI standards based on cognitive psychology research, security, and accessibility for non-technical users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cognitive Load Optimization and Information Architecture

**User Story:** As a runner using RunSight Web, I want an interface that minimizes mental effort and follows cognitive psychology principles so that I can quickly understand my performance data without feeling overwhelmed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any dashboard or insights page THEN the interface SHALL display no more than 7±2 information chunks at once, following Miller's Rule for short-term memory limitations
2. WHEN presenting complex data THEN information SHALL be chunked into meaningful, visually distinct units with clear relationships between related items
3. WHEN displaying metrics THEN intrinsic cognitive load (learning new insights) SHALL be maximized while extraneous cognitive load (visual clutter, inconsistent patterns) SHALL be minimized
4. WHEN showing data visualizations THEN they SHALL use progressive disclosure to show essential information first with detailed data available on demand
5. WHEN presenting information hierarchy THEN it SHALL follow the 5-second rule - users should understand the primary message within 5 seconds
6. WHEN displaying related information THEN it SHALL be visually grouped using Gestalt principles (proximity, similarity, closure)
7. WHEN users navigate THEN information scent SHALL be high - labels and context should clearly indicate what users will find

### Requirement 2: Recognition Over Recall and Mental Model Alignment

**User Story:** As a runner, I want the interface to leverage familiar patterns and minimize memory requirements so that I can focus on understanding my performance rather than learning how to use the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN it SHALL follow established dashboard conventions with KPIs at the top, trends in the middle, and detailed data below
2. WHEN interacting with controls THEN they SHALL use familiar web patterns (dropdowns, buttons, toggles) that users recognize from other applications
3. WHEN displaying time-based data THEN it SHALL use conventional time period selectors (Last 30 days, This Year, etc.) that users expect
4. WHEN showing performance metrics THEN it SHALL use standard running terminology and units that runners are familiar with
5. WHEN presenting data comparisons THEN it SHALL use side-by-side layouts or overlay patterns that users recognize from other analytics tools
6. WHEN displaying progress indicators THEN it SHALL use familiar visual metaphors (progress bars, completion percentages) rather than abstract representations
7. WHEN showing data relationships THEN it SHALL use conventional chart types (line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons) that users can interpret without learning new visual languages

### Requirement 3: Task Offloading and External Memory Support

**User Story:** As a runner, I want the application to remember information for me and reduce the mental effort required to use it so that I can focus on understanding my performance insights rather than operating the interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning to the application THEN it SHALL remember my preferred time periods, view settings, and last visited sections
2. WHEN viewing complex data THEN the application SHALL provide smart defaults based on common runner needs rather than requiring me to configure everything
3. WHEN comparing performance across time periods THEN the application SHALL automatically highlight significant changes rather than requiring me to calculate differences
4. WHEN viewing insights THEN contextual explanations SHALL be provided inline rather than requiring me to remember definitions from a separate help section
5. WHEN synchronizing data THEN the application SHALL show progress with meaningful descriptions of what's happening rather than abstract progress bars
6. WHEN viewing trends THEN the application SHALL automatically identify and highlight interesting patterns rather than requiring me to analyze raw data
7. WHEN using filters or selections THEN the current state SHALL be clearly visible and easily modifiable without requiring me to remember what I've selected

### Requirement 4: Production Security Validation

**User Story:** As a user deploying RunSight Web on the production stack, I want the security measures to be validated in the actual deployment environment so that I can trust the application with my sensitive running data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed to Netlify THEN security audit SHALL verify no API keys are exposed in the built frontend assets or source maps
2. WHEN testing Supabase RLS THEN policies SHALL be validated with actual user accounts to ensure data isolation works in production
3. WHEN testing Strava OAuth THEN the complete authentication flow SHALL be validated on deployed Netlify Functions with proper token storage
4. WHEN testing API integrations THEN rate limiting and error handling SHALL be validated against actual OpenWeatherMap and Strava API responses
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN error messages SHALL be validated in the production environment to ensure no sensitive information leaks
6. WHEN testing user sessions THEN session management SHALL be validated across Netlify Functions and Supabase authentication
7. WHEN conducting security audit THEN testing SHALL include actual penetration testing against the deployed application rather than just code review

### Requirement 5: Production Deployment Path Optimization

**User Story:** As a non-technical user interested in running analytics, I want to deploy RunSight Web using the actual production stack (Netlify + Supabase + OWM + Strava) by following a streamlined process so that I can get a working application without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking "Deploy to Netlify" THEN the deployment SHALL automatically configure build settings, redirects, and function settings without manual intervention
2. WHEN setting up Supabase THEN database migrations SHALL run automatically through a simple setup script or one-click process
3. WHEN configuring API keys THEN the process SHALL be optimized for the actual API provider workflows (Strava Developer Portal, OpenWeatherMap signup, Supabase dashboard)
4. WHEN following the setup guide THEN each step SHALL be tested on the actual production stack to identify real friction points
5. WHEN encountering errors THEN troubleshooting SHALL address actual deployment issues users face with Netlify Functions, Supabase RLS, and API integrations
6. WHEN testing the complete flow THEN it SHALL be validated end-to-end using fresh accounts on all services to simulate the new user experience
7. WHEN documenting the process THEN instructions SHALL include realistic time estimates and common gotchas specific to the production stack

### Requirement 6: Actionable Insights and Performance Context

**User Story:** As a dedicated runner, I want RunSight Web to provide clear, actionable insights with proper context so that I can make informed decisions about my training without needing to interpret complex data myself.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing performance trends THEN insights SHALL include clear explanations of what the data means for my training (e.g., "Your pace has improved by 15 seconds per mile over the last month")
2. WHEN examining weather correlations THEN recommendations SHALL be specific and actionable (e.g., "You run 8% faster in temperatures between 50-60°F")
3. WHEN reviewing consistency metrics THEN the application SHALL provide context about what constitutes good consistency for my activity level
4. WHEN analyzing workout types THEN suggestions SHALL be based on established training principles and my current patterns
5. WHEN viewing elevation data THEN the application SHALL explain how my hill performance compares to flat running and what this means for race preparation
6. WHEN examining pace trends THEN progress SHALL be contextualized against realistic improvement timelines and common running benchmarks
7. WHEN receiving insights THEN they SHALL be prioritized by potential impact on performance rather than presenting all data equally

### Requirement 7: Fitts's Law Compliance and Interaction Efficiency

**User Story:** As a user interacting with RunSight Web, I want all interactive elements to be appropriately sized and positioned so that I can efficiently navigate and interact with the application without precision difficulties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking or tapping interactive elements THEN buttons and clickable areas SHALL be at least 44px × 44px on mobile and 32px × 32px on desktop
2. WHEN frequently used controls are present THEN they SHALL be positioned close to related content to minimize cursor/finger travel distance
3. WHEN viewing data tables THEN clickable elements SHALL be spaced appropriately to prevent accidental clicks
4. WHEN using dropdown menus THEN they SHALL be large enough for easy selection and positioned to avoid edge-of-screen issues
5. WHEN interacting with charts THEN hover targets and clickable areas SHALL be generous enough for accurate selection
6. WHEN using mobile devices THEN touch targets SHALL account for average finger size and be positioned away from screen edges where possible
7. WHEN switching between views THEN navigation elements SHALL be consistently positioned to build muscle memory

### Requirement 8: Visual Hierarchy and Information Scent

**User Story:** As a runner scanning RunSight Web for specific information, I want clear visual hierarchy and strong information scent so that I can quickly find what I'm looking for without having to read everything.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning any page THEN the most important information SHALL be visually prominent through size, color, or positioning
2. WHEN looking for specific data THEN headings and labels SHALL clearly indicate what information is contained in each section
3. WHEN viewing charts and graphs THEN titles and axis labels SHALL be descriptive enough that users understand the content without additional explanation
4. WHEN navigating between sections THEN breadcrumbs or clear section indicators SHALL show users where they are in the information hierarchy
5. WHEN viewing lists of insights THEN each item SHALL have clear, descriptive titles that indicate the value users will get from clicking
6. WHEN scanning for trends THEN visual emphasis (color, size, icons) SHALL highlight the most significant findings
7. WHEN looking for actionable information THEN recommendations and next steps SHALL be visually distinguished from descriptive data

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Community Readiness

**User Story:** As a potential contributor or user of the open-source RunSight Web project, I want comprehensive documentation that follows progressive disclosure principles so that I can effectively use, deploy, or contribute to the project without cognitive overload.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visiting the GitHub repository THEN the README SHALL use progressive disclosure with essential information first and detailed setup instructions available through clear links
2. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN instructions SHALL be chunked into logical steps with clear success criteria for each step
3. WHEN contributing code THEN coding standards SHALL be presented with examples and rationale rather than just rules
4. WHEN reporting issues THEN issue templates SHALL guide users through a logical flow that minimizes cognitive load while gathering necessary information
5. WHEN seeking help THEN documentation SHALL use recognition over recall with searchable FAQs and visual guides where appropriate
6. WHEN understanding the architecture THEN technical documentation SHALL build from simple concepts to complex ones using familiar mental models
7. WHEN deploying for production THEN security best practices SHALL be presented as checklists with clear explanations of why each step matters
