## üîê Authentication Issues

### Issue: "Failed to get authorization URL"
**Symptoms:** 
- Can't click "Connect with Strava" button
- Error message about authorization URL

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Missing Strava credentials**
   ```bash
   # Check these are set in Netlify:
   STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

2. **Netlify function not deployed**
   - Go to Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - Verify `auth-strava` function exists
   - Check function logs for errors

**How to fix:**
1. Verify environment variables in Netlify dashboard
2. Redeploy site after adding missing variables
3. Check Netlify function logs for detailed errors

### Issue: "Authentication failed" or "Token exchange failed"
**Symptoms:**
- Redirected back from Strava but shows error
- Stuck on authentication screen

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Callback domain mismatch**
   - Strava app callback domain: `your-app.netlify.app`
   - Netlify site domain: `your-app.netlify.app`
   - These must match exactly (no `https://` in Strava settings)

2. **Incorrect redirect URI**
   ```bash
   # Should be set in Netlify:
   STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-app.netlify.app/auth/callback
   ```

**How to fix:**
1. Go to [developers.strava.com](https://developers.strava.com)
2. Edit your application
3. Set **Authorization Callback Domain** to just your domain (e.g., `amazing-app-123.netlify.app`)
4. Update `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` in Netlify to include full URL with `/auth/callback`
5. Redeploy site

### Issue: "Your session has expired"
**Symptoms:**
- Was working before, now shows authentication error
- Need to reconnect frequently

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Strava token expired** (normal after 6 hours)
   - This is expected behavior
   - Token refresh should happen automatically

2. **Token refresh failing**
   - Check Netlify function logs for refresh errors
   - Verify `STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET` is correct

**How to fix:**
1. Try logging out and reconnecting
2. Check function logs for token refresh errors
3. Verify all Strava credentials are correct

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Issues

### Issue: "Database connection failed" or "RLS policy violation"
**Symptoms:**
- Can authenticate but can't load dashboard
- Error about database permissions

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Missing Supabase credentials**
   ```bash
   # Check these are set in Netlify:
   SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ... (long string)
   ```

2. **Migrations not run**
   - Tables don't exist
   - RLS policies not set up

**How to fix:**
1. Verify Supabase credentials in Netlify dashboard
2. Run all migrations in order in Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```
   1. 20250609100000_fresh_start_simple_schema.sql
   2. 20250609110000_add_proper_rls_security.sql
   3. 20250610200000_add_geocoding_columns.sql
   4. 20250717000000_create_goals_table.sql
   ```
3. Verify tables exist in Supabase dashboard
4. Redeploy site

### Issue: "User not found" or "No data available"
**Symptoms:**
- Can authenticate but no runs appear
- Dashboard shows empty state

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **No data synced yet**
   - Need to run initial sync
   - Click "Sync Data" in dashboard

2. **RLS policies blocking access**
   - User can't access their own data
   - Check RLS policies in Supabase

**How to fix:**
1. Try syncing data first
2. Check Supabase Auth users to verify user exists
3. Verify RLS policies allow user access to their data

## üîÑ Data Sync Issues

### Issue: "Sync failed" or "Failed to fetch activities"
**Symptoms:**
- Sync starts but fails partway through
- Error messages during sync process

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Strava API rate limiting**
   - Too many requests too quickly
   - Normal for large datasets

2. **Network timeouts**
   - Large sync operations timing out
   - Netlify function timeout (10 seconds max)

**How to fix:**
1. Try syncing smaller time periods (e.g., "Last 7 days")
2. Wait 15 minutes between sync attempts
3. For large datasets, sync in smaller chunks

### Issue: "Some activities failed to sync"
**Symptoms:**
- Partial sync success
- Some runs missing from dashboard

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Data validation errors**
   - Some Strava activities have invalid data
   - GPS errors or missing required fields

2. **API inconsistencies**
   - Strava API returning malformed data
   - Network issues during sync

**How to fix:**
1. This is often normal - some activities have data issues
2. Try syncing again to catch missed activities
3. Check Netlify function logs for specific errors

## üå§Ô∏è Weather Data Issues

### Issue: "No weather data" or weather icons missing
**Symptoms:**
- Runs sync successfully but no weather information
- Weather section shows "No data available"

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **API key not activated**
   - OpenWeatherMap keys take 10-60 minutes to activate
   - Free tier has limited historical data

2. **Missing API key**
   ```bash
   # Check this is set in Netlify:
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

3. **Free tier limitations**
   - Free tier only has current weather
   - Historical weather requires paid plan ($40/month)

**How to fix:**
1. Wait 1 hour after creating OpenWeatherMap account
2. Test API key: `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_KEY`
3. For full historical weather, upgrade to paid plan
4. Check Netlify function logs for weather API errors

### Issue: "Weather API quota exceeded"
**Symptoms:**
- Weather worked before, now shows errors
- Error about daily limits

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Free tier daily limit reached** (1000 calls/day)
2. **Too many sync operations**

**How to fix:**
1. Wait until next day for quota reset
2. Upgrade to paid OpenWeatherMap plan
3. Reduce sync frequency

   ```bash
   # Set in netlify.toml:
   [build.environment]
   NODE_VERSION = "18"
   ```

2. **Missing dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Run locally to check:
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Environment variable issues**
   - Build trying to access missing variables
   - Check build logs for specific missing vars

**How to fix:**
1. Check build logs for specific error messages
2. Verify Node version is set to 18
3. Test build locally: `npm run build`
4. Ensure all required environment variables are set

### Issue: "Functions not working" or 404 errors on API calls
**Symptoms:**
- Site loads but API calls fail
- 404 errors on `/.netlify/functions/*` endpoints

**Causes & Solutions:**
1. **Functions not deployed**
   - Check Netlify dashboard ‚Üí Functions
   - Should see: `auth-strava`, `get-runs`, `sync-data`

2. **Function build errors**
   - Check function logs for errors
   - Verify function code is correct

**How to fix:**
1. Verify functions appear in Netlify dashboard
2. Check function logs for errors
3. Redeploy site to rebuild functions
