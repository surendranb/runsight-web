# üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

## üö® **Critical Security Fix Applied**

The initial implementation had a **major security vulnerability** where users could potentially see each other's data. This has been fixed with proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## üî¥ **Previous Security Issues (FIXED)**

### Issue 1: No Data Isolation
- **Problem**: `GRANT ALL ON public.runs TO authenticated` allowed any authenticated user to see all data
- **Risk**: User A could see User B's running data
- **Fix**: Implemented RLS policies with `auth.uid() = user_id` filtering

### Issue 2: Application-Level Security Only
- **Problem**: Security was only enforced in application code
- **Risk**: Direct database access could bypass security
- **Fix**: Database-level RLS policies enforce security at the data layer

## ‚úÖ **Current Security Model**

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
```sql
-- Users can only see their own runs
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own runs" ON public.runs
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only insert runs for themselves  
CREATE POLICY "Users can only insert their own runs" ON public.runs
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only update their own runs
CREATE POLICY "Users can only update their own runs" ON public.runs
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only delete their own runs
CREATE POLICY "Users can only delete their own runs" ON public.runs
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### How It Works
1. **Authentication**: Users authenticate via Supabase Auth with Strava OAuth
2. **User ID**: Each user gets a unique UUID from `auth.users.id`
3. **Data Association**: All runs are linked to `user_id` 
4. **RLS Enforcement**: Database automatically filters queries by `auth.uid() = user_id`
5. **Multi-Layer Security**: Both application code AND database enforce isolation

## üß™ **Security Testing**

### Automated Tests
- RLS policies are verified during migration
- Application code filters by user ID
- Database enforces policies at data layer

### Manual Testing
1. Create multiple test users
2. Insert runs for each user
3. Verify each user only sees their own data
4. Test direct database queries (should be filtered)

## üîí **Security Guarantees**

### ‚úÖ **What's Protected**
- **Data Isolation**: Users can only see their own runs
- **Write Protection**: Users can only modify their own data  
- **Database Level**: Security enforced even with direct DB access
- **API Level**: Application code also filters by user ID

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limitations**
- **Strava ID Uniqueness**: Same Strava activity could theoretically be imported by multiple users (edge case)
- **Token Security**: Strava tokens stored in user metadata (consider encryption for production)

## üöÄ **Deployment Steps**

### 1. Apply Security Migration
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
-- Copy content from: supabase/migrations/20250609110000_add_proper_rls_security.sql
```

### 2. Verify Security
```sql
-- Run security tests:
-- Copy content from: SECURITY_TEST.sql
```

### 3. Test Multi-User Flow
1. Create test accounts with different Strava credentials
2. Import runs for each user
3. Verify data isolation in dashboard

## üìä **Security Verification**

After applying the security migration, verify:

```sql
-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'runs';

-- Check policies exist  
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'runs';

-- Test current user context
SELECT auth.uid() as my_user_id;
```

## üéØ **Production Recommendations**

### Additional Security Measures
1. **Token Encryption**: Encrypt Strava tokens in user metadata
2. **Rate Limiting**: Add API rate limiting per user
3. **Audit Logging**: Log data access for security monitoring
4. **Session Management**: Implement proper session timeouts

### Monitoring
- Monitor for unusual data access patterns
- Alert on RLS policy violations
- Track authentication failures

This security model ensures that **each user can only see and modify their own running data**, providing complete data isolation in a multi-user environment.
