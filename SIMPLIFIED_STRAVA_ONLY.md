## 🎯 **Simplified Flow**

### **Perfect Flow:**
1. **Login via Strava** ✅

3. **Import activities** directly to database
4. **See analytics** with running data

### **Expected Experience:**
```
Login → "Welcome to RunSight!" → Choose sync range → 
"Saving activity 1/6: Morning Run" → 
"Saving activity 2/6: Evening Jog" → 
"Sync complete! Saved 6 activities to database." → 
Dashboard with running analytics
```
